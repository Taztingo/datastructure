General:
	A collection of c++ data structures that are based off of the standard c++ 	data structures from cplusplus.com. This was created to simply help
	teach me the c++ language.

Author:

Thanks:
	Thank you cplusplus.com for having excellent documentation of the c++
	data structures.

Install:
	Simply include the header file in any c++ program.
	Ex: #include <my_queue.h>

Copying:
	This is free to use, and acknowledgement is not required but appreciated.

Future:
	Sort and = for my_list.h
	Iterator capability
	Rest of data structures
